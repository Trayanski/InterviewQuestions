I started at 2pm and finished at 5:51pm. (uk time)

It took me 20 minutes to finish Q4.

Total time 4h +-10min

"The assessment is aimed for 2-3 hours work but feel free to take a bit longer if you feel that gives us a better representation of your capabilities."
Ps: I hope that 1h is "a bit longer" than expected.
